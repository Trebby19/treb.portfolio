        <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Kilbert Villanueva, and I'm a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student right now.
            <br>I have a strong interest in how technology is affecting our planet.
            <br>The countless opportunities IT presents to resolve difficult issues and enhance people's lives are what drew me to the field.
            <br>I chose this course with the intention of gaining the abilities and information required to succeed in a variety of fields, including data analysis, cybersecurity, and software development.
            <br>I think IT is the ideal fusion of imagination, ingenuity, and reason, and it perfectly fits my ambitions and desires.
            <br>I appreciate you stopping by my webpage!

        <h4>Background on Information Technology</h4>
        <p>
            I'm a second-year IT student who is presently laying a solid foundation in a number of information technology-related areas. I'm studying database administration with  web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and programming languages like Python and Java. Additionally, I'm learning more about IT support and networking principles.
            I am honing my practical skills and teamwork qualities through practical projects and group work. My love of technology motivates me to keep up with developments and trends in the field. As I pursue my education, I want to learn more and get involved in more specific IT fields.
